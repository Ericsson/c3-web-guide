## Display name
You can change the display name of a user using `client.setName('...')`. In contrast to a user's user ID (which looks something like `@username:domain`, and can't be changed), the display name of a user doesn't have to be unique, and can be changed at any time.

Try pressing the `Run code` button on the right and see what happens. You can also change the code to whatever you like and run it again. If you want to reset the code to its original state, just press the `Reset` button.
